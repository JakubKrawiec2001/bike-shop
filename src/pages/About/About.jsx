							best, to give cyclists the best bikes for everyday riding or
							competitive sports. One of the key parameters of today's bicycles
							is lightness and durability. The experience gained during
							professional MTB competitions and the input of our competitors and
							technologists helped us create new, ultra-light, professional
							bicycles.
